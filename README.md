# Pizza-Ordering-Chatbox

This assignment is for the CIS 110 Computer Programming Design course. The instructor's role in this code was to guide us through various functions and code situations.
The instructor provided this code, which I then customized and altered.
A user will be given options to order and customize a pizza. There are safeguards in place to ensure the correct data types are being enforced when needed. For example: When asking the user how many pizzas they need, it will continue to prompt the user until a numerical value is entered. 

This was a fun project. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
